A website dedicated to one of my favorite new shows: Delicious in Dungeon. An anime about a group of adventurers who must delve deep into an ancient dungeon to rescue their friend. While finding new and exciting ways to cook the local flora and fauna.

This project uses React Routes, a custom Context, and custom Tailwind classes.

INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
This project uses React, Typescript, and Tailwind CSS.

NPM must be initialized using "npm i" in the terminal, make sure you are in the project's outer-most directory. This should generate the necessary node modules.

It will take a while but afterward, just run "npm start" and the site should open in your browser.
